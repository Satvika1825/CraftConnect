Problem Aimed to Solve:
- Access and Market Challenges: Rural artisans often lack access to global markets, fair trade practices, and modern business resources. Traditional marketplaces frequently exploit artisans due to insufficient transparency, and there is a growing need for sustainable and ethical practices in global supply chains.

Why It Matters:
- Significance of the Problem:
  - Economic Impact:Rural artisans face difficulties in reaching international consumers, leading to limited income opportunities and economic instability.
  - Cultural Preservation:Traditional crafts are at risk of disappearing due to inadequate support and exposure.
  - Sustainability: The environmental impact of traditional supply chains demands more sustainable practices.

- Impact on Target Audience:
  - Artisans:Improved access to markets, fair pricing, and resources for skill development.
  - Consumers:Enhanced ability to purchase authentic, ethically produced crafts with transparency.
  - Communities: Increased economic growth and preservation of cultural heritage.
